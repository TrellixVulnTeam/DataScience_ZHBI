	Always save file name as "Dockerfile"
				#Use python as base image
				FROM python:3.7-slim

				#Use working directory /app
				WORKDIR /app

				#Copy all the contents of current directory to /app
				ADD . /app

				#Installing required packages
				RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

				#Opening the port for app
				EXPOSE 5000

				#Set environment variable
				ENV NAME OpentoAll

				#run python program
				CMD ["python3","server.py"]
2. create requirements.txt file where you must include all your pip install commands
	Go inside your working directory and type
	Command: pip freeze 
	It gives list of all pip commands that is to be installed for particular image
	
	<Note: In order to make your file into docker specify app.run(host='0.0.0.0') in your .py file >


3. Build the docker file and Run the docker file with command:
	docker build -t dockerimage_name:latest .

4. Now run your application 
	docker run -p 5000:5000 dockerimage_name:latest

5. Create docker repository into docker website
