      "book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\n",
      "the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\n",
      "evidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was\n",
      "successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\n",
      "Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\n",
      "Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\n",
      "the next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\n",

      "  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \n",
      "etymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\n",
      "Avestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\n",
      "would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\n",

      "probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\n",
      "the six tribes of the Medes.\n",
      "  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\n",
      "priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\n",
      "responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\n",
      "knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\n",
      "priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\n",
      "monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\n",
      "through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\n",
      "Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\n",

      "concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\n",
      "(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\n",
      "demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\n",
      "Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\n",
      "Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\n",
      "the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\n",
      "  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\n",
      "sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\n",
      "possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\n",
      "attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\n",
      "  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\n",
      "are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\n",
      "the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\n",
      "untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\n",
      "Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\n",
      "not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\n",
      "in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\n",
      "purity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\n",
      "and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\n",
      "the root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\n",
      "has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\n",
      "ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\n",
      "there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\n",
      "magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\n",
      "Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\n",
      "a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\n",
      "the Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \n",
      "perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \n",
      "(Gershevitch, 1964).\n",
      "  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\n",
      "Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\n",
      "particular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\n",
      "the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\n",
      "a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\n",
      "high priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\n",
      "hierarchy.\n",
      "  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\n",
      "khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\n",
      "the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\n",
      "The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\n",
      "of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\n",
      "community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\n",
      "Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\n",
      "rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\n",
      "in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\n",
      "wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\n",
      "of Central Asia.\n",
      "  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\n",
      "offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\n",
      "ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\n",
      "custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\n",
      "relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\n",
      "called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\n",
      "known for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\n",
      "such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\n",
      "tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\n",
      "felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\n",
      "and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\n",
      "breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\n",
      "that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\n",
      "that of the priesthood: white.\n",
      "  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\n",
      "possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\n",
      "gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\n",
      "professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\n",
      "inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\n",
      "jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\n",
      "they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\n",
      "for teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\n",
      "the \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\n",
      "the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\n",
      "master of himself.\n",
      "  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\n",
      "influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\n",
      "several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\n",
      "Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\n",
      "Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\n",
      "the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\n",
      "in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\n",
      "as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\n",
      "  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\n",
      "renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\n",
      "the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\n",
      "who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\n",
      "Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\n",
      "also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\n",
      "this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\n",
      "like \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\n",
      "Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\n",
      "had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\n",
      "  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\n",
      "is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\n",
      "western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\n",
      "have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\n",
      "Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\n",
      "contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\n",
      "varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\n",
      "  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\n",
      "varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\n",
      "historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\n",
      "customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\n",
      "belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\n",
      "and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\n",
      "even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\n",
      "Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\n",
      "Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\n",
      "placed themselves under his venerable name.\n",
      "  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\n",
      "eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\n",
      "elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\n",
      "often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\n",
      "Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\n",
      "daivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\n",
      "texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\n",
      "practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\n",
      "chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\n",
      "supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\n",
      "Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\n",
      "all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\n",
      "land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\n",
      "has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\n",
      "absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\n",
      "priesthood, would be very strange.\n",
      "  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\n",
      "corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\n",
      "first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\n",
      "directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\n",
      "us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\n",
      "the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\n",
      "of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\n",
      "spirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\n",
      "Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\n",
      "formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\n",
      "astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\n",
      "Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\n",
      "to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\n",
      "see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\n",
      "we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\n",
      "  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\n",
      "important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in\n",
      "the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\n",

      "processes, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable\n",
      "phenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. \n",

      "affected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not\n",

      "\n",
      "OK, here's at least one Christian's answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes\n",
      "sense.  Matt 5:17 \"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or\n",
      "the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\"  Jesus lived\n",
      "under the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises\n",
      "of the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey\n",
      "God's purposes.\n",
      "\n",

      "away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,\n",
      "until all is accomplished.\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last \n",
      "phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \"accomplished\" what the \n",
      "Law was supposed to accomplish.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Verse 19:  \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\n",
      "and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;\n",
      "but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the\n",
      "kingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \n",
      "people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \n",
      "must have received about \"doing away with the Law.\"  That was not \n",
      "Jesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it \n",

      "people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your \n",
      "heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \"doing \n",
      "away with the Law\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as \n",
      "equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious \n",
      "leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only \n",
      "God's Law.\n",

      "on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people \n",
      "understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which \n",
      "had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the \n",
      "Law in this way:\n",
      "\n",
      "[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being \n",
      "shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore \n",
      "the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be \n",

      "now, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\"  The law has been \"fulfilled\" \n",
      "as Christ said he would do.\n",
      "\n",
      "God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same\n",
      "personality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \"last\n",
      "will and testament\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. \n",
      "It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are\n",
      "re-expressed in Christianity. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and \n",
      "Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes \n",
      "sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to \n",

      "used of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the\n",
      "Bible. In the KJV, \"Jehovah\" is rendered primarily \"LORD,\" sometimes\n",
      "\"GOD,\" and rarely \"Lord.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "        Now that we understand something about the words \"Elohim\" and\n",

      "McConkie's attack on Christians for believing the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\n",
      "In trying to prove that \"Jehovah\" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie\n",
      "cited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie's\n",
      "interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.\n",
      "Remember, McConkie said the Father is not \"Jehovah;\" He is only\n",
      "\"Elohim.\" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's\n",
      "interpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit\n",
      "  and he testified, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right\n",
      "  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1.) Two\n",
      "  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater\n",
      "  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of\n",
      "  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this\n",
      "  Messianic prophecy?\n",
      "  \"What think ye of Christ?\" our Lord asked certain of his detractors\n",
      "  toward the end of his mortal ministry. \"Whose son is he?\" Is Christ\n",
      "  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent\n",
      "  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he\n",
      "  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the\n",
      "  Jews. And so they answered, \"The Son of David.\"\n",
      "  David's son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our\n",
      "  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,\n",
      "  asked, \"How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord\n",
      "  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine\n",
      "  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his\n",
      "  son?\" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the\n",
      "  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him\n",
      "  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake\n",
      "  unto David's Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is\n",
      "  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: '_The\n",
      "  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my\n",
      "  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up\n",
      "  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to\n",
      "  sit on my right hand forever.' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)\n",
      "  (emphasis added)\n",
      "\n",
      "        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following\n",
      "remark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6\n",
      "reads: \"The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the\n",
      "Son]...\" (brackets in original)\n",
      "\n",
      "        McConkie clearly stated that it is \"Elohim\" the Father who is\n",
      "speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at\n",
      "the Hebrew word translated \"LORD,\" it becomes apparent that either the\n",
      "first \"LORD\" is not the Father or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Either\n",
      "way McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right\n",
      "  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)\n",
      "\n",
      "        The first \"LORD\" in this verse is \"Jehovah\" who Mormonism says\n",
      "is Christ, not the Father. The second \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word \"Adon\"\n",
      "(singular for \"Adonai,\" meaning master or lord). If the first \"LORD\" is\n",
      "the Father and the second \"Lord\" is the Son, then the Father is\n",
      "\"Jehovah\" and the Son is \"Adon.\" However, if the Father is not \"Jehovah\"\n",
      "as McConkie claimed, then the first \"LORD\" is \"Jehovah\" the Son, but\n",
      "who, then, is \"Adon?\" Obviously the Father is \"Jehovah\" in this Psalm,\n",
      "and His Son is \"Adon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated\n",
      "the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,\" _Isaiah quoted the\n",
      "  Father as saying of Christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep\n",
      "  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\n",
      "  Gentiles.\" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)\n",
      "\n",
      "        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage\n",
      "which reads:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\n",
      "  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\n",
      "  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)\n",
      "\n",
      "        According to McConkie, \"I the LORD\" refers to the Father, and\n",
      "\"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to Christ. However, the \"LORD\" who is speaking\n",
      "is \"Jehovah\" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking\n",
      "or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie\n",
      "stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"The same Psalm says: \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they\n",
      "  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord\n",
      "  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in\n",
      "  him.\" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is\n",
      "  found in these words: \"The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\n",

      "\n",
      "        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment \"as Jesus hung\n",

      "Christ. Who, then, was the \"LORD\" in whom he trusted? It was \"Jehovah\"\n",
      "the Father.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,\n",
      "McConkie stated the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our\n",
      "  Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: \"They took counsel\n",

      "\n",
      "        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ's \"arrest and\n",
      "judicial trials.\" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While\n",
      "McConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included\n",
      "to give a complete understanding of the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while\n",

      "  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)\n",
      "\n",
      "        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes\n",
      "on to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the \"LORD\" who is called His\n",
      "\"God\" or \"Elohim.\" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is\n",
      "\"Elohim\" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the \"Elohim\" of the\n",
      "man Jesus is \"Jehovah\" the Father.\n",
      "\n",
      "        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses\n",
      "will be considered in this examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\n",

      "\n",
      "        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas' role in\n",

      "\"lifted up his heel,\" the pronouns \"mine,\" \"I,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in verse\n",
      "9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there\n",
      "is a change of pronoun to \"thou,\" which refers to the \"LORD\" (Jehovah).\n",
      "Then the pronouns \"me\" and \"I\" which refer to Christ are used again.\n",
      "That means Christ was speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Father in these verses.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps.\n",
      "        110:4.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,\n",

      "  ever after the order of Melchizedek.\" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,\n",
      "  p. 450)\n",
      "\n",
      "        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.\n",

      "McConkie is right and Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but the Father is not, then\n",
      "the \"LORD\" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one\n",

      "Bible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;\n",
      "6:20; 7); therefore, the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie\n",
      "stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...\n",
      "     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....\n",

      "\n",
      "        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to \"the atoning\n",
      "sacrifice of the future Messiah.\" However, what he failed to mention is\n",
      "that they also prove that the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Verse 6 reads: \"All\n",
      "we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\n",
      "and the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us\n",

      "verses.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Remember, McConkie stated that \"some sectarians even believe\n",
      "that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,\" and that Christ \"came into\n",
      "mortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. He called this concept\n",
      "\"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" To prove that it is McConkie who is\n",
      "misinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.\n",
      "7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding\n",
      "these Scriptures:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of\n",
      "  the Seed of David: \"I will be his father, and he shall be my son.\" (2\n",
      "  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly\n",
      "  Messianic, occurs this statement: \"Thou art my Son; this day have I\n",
      "  begotten thee.\" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in\n",
      "  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the\n",
      "  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)\n",
      "\n",
      "        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7\n",
      "refer to Christ who \"would come as the Son of God.\" Since McConkie first\n",
      "referenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with\n",
      "verse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people\n",
      "  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the\n",
      "  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\n",
      "  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,\n",
      "  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy\n",
      "  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\n",
      "  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of\n",
      "  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2\n",
      "  Sam. 7:11-14)\n",
      "\n",
      "        These verses teach that the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) would have a Son,\n",
      "the Messiah.\n",
      "        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination\n",
      "will include verse 8. Notice that it is the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) who says,\n",
      "\"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou\n",

      "  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,\n",
      "  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\n",
      "\n",
      "        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are \"clearly Messianic,\"\n",
      "and he acknowledged they teach that \"Christ would come as the Son of\n",
      "God.\" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these\n",
      "Scriptures also teach that the Father is \"Jehovah\" and that the\n",
      "\"sectarians\" who believe \"Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son\" is\n",

      "the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,\n",
      "  this is he of whom it is written_: \"He shall stand and feed in the\n",

      "is referred to as \"Jehovah his Elohim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses\n",
      "McConkie stated the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"A number of Messianic passages speak of \"the Lord, and...his\n",
      "  anointed\" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated\n",
      "  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus\n",
      "  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah's prophecy. \"The\n",
      "  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek\" (Isa.\n",
      "  61:1), and then saying: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your\n",
      "  ears\" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)\n",
      "\n",
      "        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\n",
      "  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "        McConkie said the \"anointed\" one was Christ. If that is true,\n",
      "who was \"Jehovah?\" If \"Jehovah\" is always Christ, who was the \"anointed\"\n",
      "one? Obviously \"Jehovah\" is referring to God the Father and the\n",
      "\"anointed\" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie\n",
      "cited is Isa. 61:1 which states:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the\n",
      "  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\n",
      "  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to\n",
      "  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\n",
      "\n",
      "        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open\n",
      "was Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse\n",
      "says the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same\n",
      "problem. If \"Jehovah\" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,\n",
      "then Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, \"Jesus\n",
      "applied these passages to himself.\" Therefore, the \"Jehovah\" who\n",
      "anointed Christ is God the Father.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other\n",
      "Mormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not \"Jehovah.\"\n",
      "However, these should be enough to expose their error.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Now, what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but\n",

      "he was a Mede, largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtra\n",

      "provide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. This\n",

      "themselves.\n",
      "5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from\n",

      "\n",
      "Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\n",

      "successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\n",
      "Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\n",

      "towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\n",
      "5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\n",
      "discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\n",
      "tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\n",
      "really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\n",
      "plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\n",
      "use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\n",
      "the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\n",
      "view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\n",
      "Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\n",
      "Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\n",

      "  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \n",
      "etymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\n",
      "Avestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\n",
      "would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\n",

      "probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\n",
      "the six tribes of the Medes.\n",
      "  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\n",
      "priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\n",
      "responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\n",
      "knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\n",
      "priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\n",
      "monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\n",
      "through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\n",
      "Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\n",
      "and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\n",
      "concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\n",
      "(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\n",
      "demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\n",
      "Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\n",
      "Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\n",
      "the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\n",
      "  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\n",
      "sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\n",
      "possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\n",
      "attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\n",
      "  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\n",
      "are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\n",
      "the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\n",
      "untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\n",
      "Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\n",
      "not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\n",
      "in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\n",
      "purity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\n",
      "and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\n",
      "the root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\n",
      "has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\n",
      "ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\n",
      "there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\n",
      "magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\n",
      "Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\n",
      "a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\n",
      "the Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \n",
      "perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \n",
      "(Gershevitch, 1964).\n",
      "  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\n",
      "Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\n",
      "particular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\n",
      "the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\n",
      "a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\n",
      "high priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\n",
      "hierarchy.\n",
      "  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\n",
      "khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\n",
      "the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\n",
      "The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\n",
      "of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\n",
      "community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\n",
      "Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\n",
      "rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\n",
      "in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\n",
      "wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\n",
      "of Central Asia.\n",
      "  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\n",
      "offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\n",
      "ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\n",
      "custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\n",
      "relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\n",
      "called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\n",
      "known for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\n",
      "such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\n",
      "tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\n",
      "felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\n",
      "and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\n",
      "breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\n",
      "that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\n",
      "that of the priesthood: white.\n",
      "  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\n",
      "possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\n",
      "gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\n",
      "professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\n",
      "inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\n",
      "jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\n",
      "they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\n",
      "for teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\n",
      "the \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\n",
      "the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\n",
      "master of himself.\n",
      "  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\n",
      "influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\n",
      "several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\n",
      "Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\n",
      "Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\n",
      "the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\n",
      "in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\n",
      "as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\n",
      "  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\n",
      "renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\n",
      "the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\n",
      "who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\n",
      "Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\n",
      "also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\n",
      "this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\n",
      "like \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\n",
      "Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\n",
      "had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\n",
      "  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\n",
      "is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\n",
      "western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\n",
      "have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\n",
      "Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\n",
      "contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\n",
      "varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\n",
      "  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\n",
      "varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\n",
      "historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\n",
      "customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\n",
      "belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\n",
      "and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\n",
      "even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\n",
      "Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\n",
      "Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\n",
      "placed themselves under his venerable name.\n",
      "  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\n",
      "eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\n",
      "elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\n",
      "often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\n",
      "Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\n",
      "daivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\n",
      "texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\n",
      "practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\n",
      "chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\n",
      "supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\n",
      "Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\n",
      "all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\n",
      "land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\n",
      "has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\n",
      "absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\n",
      "priesthood, would be very strange.\n",
      "  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\n",
      "corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\n",
      "first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\n",
      "directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\n",
      "us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\n",
      "the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\n",
      "of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\n",
      "spirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\n",

      "processes, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable\n",
      "phenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. \n",

      "affected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not\n",

      "\n",
      "Verse 19:  \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\n",

      "kingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \n",
      "people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \n",

      "In trying to prove that \"Jehovah\" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie\n",
      "cited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie's\n",
      "interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.\n",
      "Remember, McConkie said the Father is not \"Jehovah;\" He is only\n",
      "\"Elohim.\" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's\n",
      "interpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit\n",
      "  and he testified, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right\n",
      "  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1.) Two\n",
      "  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater\n",
      "  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of\n",
      "  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this\n",
      "  Messianic prophecy?\n",
      "  \"What think ye of Christ?\" our Lord asked certain of his detractors\n",
      "  toward the end of his mortal ministry. \"Whose son is he?\" Is Christ\n",
      "  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent\n",
      "  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he\n",
      "  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the\n",
      "  Jews. And so they answered, \"The Son of David.\"\n",
      "  David's son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our\n",
      "  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,\n",
      "  asked, \"How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord\n",
      "  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine\n",
      "  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his\n",
      "  son?\" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the\n",
      "  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him\n",
      "  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake\n",
      "  unto David's Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is\n",
      "  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: '_The\n",
      "  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my\n",
      "  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up\n",
      "  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to\n",
      "  sit on my right hand forever.' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)\n",

      "\n",
      "        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following\n",
      "remark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6\n",
      "reads: \"The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the\n",
      "Son]...\" (brackets in original)\n",
      "\n",
      "        McConkie clearly stated that it is \"Elohim\" the Father who is\n",
      "speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at\n",
      "the Hebrew word translated \"LORD,\" it becomes apparent that either the\n",
      "first \"LORD\" is not the Father or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Either\n",
      "way McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right\n",
      "  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)\n",
      "\n",
      "        The first \"LORD\" in this verse is \"Jehovah\" who Mormonism says\n",
      "is Christ, not the Father. The second \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word \"Adon\"\n",
      "(singular for \"Adonai,\" meaning master or lord). If the first \"LORD\" is\n",
      "the Father and the second \"Lord\" is the Son, then the Father is\n",
      "\"Jehovah\" and the Son is \"Adon.\" However, if the Father is not \"Jehovah\"\n",
      "as McConkie claimed, then the first \"LORD\" is \"Jehovah\" the Son, but\n",
      "who, then, is \"Adon?\" Obviously the Father is \"Jehovah\" in this Psalm,\n",
      "and His Son is \"Adon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated\n",
      "the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,\" _Isaiah quoted the\n",
      "  Father as saying of Christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep\n",
      "  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\n",
      "  Gentiles.\" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)\n",
      "\n",
      "        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage\n",
      "which reads:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\n",
      "  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\n",
      "  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)\n",
      "\n",
      "        According to McConkie, \"I the LORD\" refers to the Father, and\n",
      "\"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to Christ. However, the \"LORD\" who is speaking\n",
      "is \"Jehovah\" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking\n",
      "or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie\n",
      "stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"The same Psalm says: \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they\n",

      "\n",
      "        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment \"as Jesus hung\n",

      "the Father.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,\n",

      "\n",
      "  \"With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our\n",
      "  Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: \"They took counsel\n",

      "McConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included\n",

      "        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes\n",
      "on to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the \"LORD\" who is called His\n",
      "\"God\" or \"Elohim.\" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is\n",
      "\"Elohim\" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the \"Elohim\" of the\n",
      "man Jesus is \"Jehovah\" the Father.\n",
      "\n",
      "        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses\n",
      "will be considered in this examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\n",

      "\n",
      "        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas' role in\n",

      "\"lifted up his heel,\" the pronouns \"mine,\" \"I,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in verse\n",
      "9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there\n",

      "Then the pronouns \"me\" and \"I\" which refer to Christ are used again.\n",
      "That means Christ was speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Father in these verses.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps.\n",
      "        110:4.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,\n",

      "\n",
      "        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie\n",
      "stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...\n",
      "     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....\n",

      "\n",
      "        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to \"the atoning\n",

      "that they also prove that the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Verse 6 reads: \"All\n",
      "we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\n",
      "and the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us\n",

      "        Remember, McConkie stated that \"some sectarians even believe\n",
      "that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,\" and that Christ \"came into\n",
      "mortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. He called this concept\n",
      "\"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" To prove that it is McConkie who is\n",
      "misinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.\n",
      "7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding\n",
      "these Scriptures:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of\n",
      "  the Seed of David: \"I will be his father, and he shall be my son.\" (2\n",
      "  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly\n",
      "  Messianic, occurs this statement: \"Thou art my Son; this day have I\n",
      "  begotten thee.\" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in\n",
      "  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the\n",
      "  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)\n",
      "\n",
      "        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7\n",
      "refer to Christ who \"would come as the Son of God.\" Since McConkie first\n",
      "referenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with\n",
      "verse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people\n",
      "  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the\n",
      "  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\n",
      "  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,\n",
      "  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy\n",
      "  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\n",

      "  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2\n",

      "        These verses teach that the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) would have a Son,\n",
      "the Messiah.\n",
      "        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination\n",
      "will include verse 8. Notice that it is the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) who says,\n",
      "\"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\"\n",

      "  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\n",
      "\n",
      "        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are \"clearly Messianic,\"\n",
      "and he acknowledged they teach that \"Christ would come as the Son of\n",
      "God.\" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these\n",

      "the following:\n",

      "\n",
      "        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses\n",
      "McConkie stated the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"A number of Messianic passages speak of \"the Lord, and...his\n",
      "  anointed\" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated\n",
      "  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus\n",
      "  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah's prophecy. \"The\n",
      "  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek\" (Isa.\n",
      "  61:1), and then saying: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your\n",
      "  ears\" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)\n",
      "\n",
      "        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\n",
      "  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "        McConkie said the \"anointed\" one was Christ. If that is true,\n",
      "who was \"Jehovah?\" If \"Jehovah\" is always Christ, who was the \"anointed\"\n",
      "one? Obviously \"Jehovah\" is referring to God the Father and the\n",
      "\"anointed\" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie\n",
      "cited is Isa. 61:1 which states:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the\n",
      "  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\n",
      "  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to\n",
      "  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\n",
      "\n",
      "        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open\n",
      "was Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse\n",
      "says the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same\n",
      "problem. If \"Jehovah\" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,\n",
      "then Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, \"Jesus\n",
      "applied these passages to himself.\" Therefore, the \"Jehovah\" who\n",
      "anointed Christ is God the Father.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other\n",
      "Mormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not \"Jehovah.\"\n",
      "However, these should be enough to expose their error.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Now, what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but\n",
