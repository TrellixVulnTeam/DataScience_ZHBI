This is pretty much October on a parchment-lined baking sheet. They want to be packed in a basket so they can go apple picking with you and to sneak in the car to join you for a leaf-peeping drive. They want to come to brunch with you and deserve to be served with warm apple cider, whether getting lost in a corn maze or searching for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5084046746/">the best pumpkin to carve</a>.

<p>Have we spoken this week? If we have, I&#8217;ve probably gone on and on about them, about how I never really was into that whole apple-cheddar thing but these, these changed things. They&#8217;re absolutely fantastic. They&#8217;re from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393059537?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=smitten-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0393059537">The Perfect Finish</a>, which is a dessert cookbook by Bill Yosses, who is now the executive pastry chef at The White House (but not when he wrote this) and Melissa Clark, who I suspect you&#8217;re <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/c/melissa_clark/index.html?inline=nyt-per">already quite fond of</a>. When I first saw the recipe, I rejected it as fussy for making you roast apples (in one-sixteenths!) just to let a stand mixer bang them up. I snorted over how chefs always like to boast that their recipes are &#8220;fairly simple&#8221; for home cooks but then use weights measured to the one hundredth of a gram, fooling nobody.</p>

<p>And then I made them. And I shut up because these are blissful. Just a little sweet with a shaggy sugared lid, a not-too-intensely cheddar background with random chunks of baked apples throughout. All that! In a <i>scone</i>. Oof, I&#8217;m obsessed and about to make my third batch because I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to go anywhere this weekend without some, fresh from the oven. Suddenly, it wouldn&#8217;t be October without them. Don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you.</p>

</p><p><b>Apple and Cheddar Scones</b><br />
Barely tweaked from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393059537?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=smitten-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0393059537">The Perfect Finish</a></p>
<p>Makes 6 generous scones</p>
<p>2 firm tart apples (1 pound or <s>2</s> <i>454</i> grams)<br />
1 1/2 cups (6.75 ounces or 195 grams) all-purpose flour<br />
1/4 cup sugar plus 1 1/2 tablespoons for sprinkling (total of 2.2 ounces or 63 grams)<br />
1/2 tablespoon (7 grams) baking powder<br />
1/2 teaspoon salt (3 grams) plus additional for egg wash<br />
6 tablespoons (3 ounces or 85 grams)unsalted butter, chilled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes plus additional for baking sheet if not lining it with parchment<br />
1/2 cup (2.25 ounces or 65 grams) sharp cheddar, shredded (white is recommended, I assume for aesthetics)<br />
1/4 cup (2 ounces) heavy cream<br />
2 large eggs</p>
<p>Position a rack at the center of oven and preheat oven to 375 &#176;F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
<p>Peel and core apples, then cut them into one-sixteenths. (I assumed this meant chunks, not slivers.) Placed them in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake them until they take on a little color and feel dry to the touch, about 20 minutes. They will be about half-baked. Let them cool completely. (You can speed this up in the fridge, as I did.) Leave oven on.</p>
<p>Sift or whisk flour, sugar, baking powder and salt together. Set aside. Place butter in the bowl of an electric mixer with a paddle attachment, along with cooled apple chunks, cheese, cream and one egg. Sprinkle flour mixture over the top and mix on low speed until the dough just comes together. Do not overmix.</p>
<p>[Don't have a stand or hand mixer? I'd rub the cold butter into the flour mixture with my fingertips or with a pastry blender, hand-chop the apples coarsely and mix the rest together with a wooden spoon until combined. It might feel awkward, but it should all come together. Again, don't overmix it though it will be harder to do this by hand.]</p>
<p>Generously flour your counter top and place the scone dough on top of it. Sprinkle with flour. Use a rolling pin to gently roll (or use your hands to pat) the dough into a 1 1/4-inch thick, 6-inch circle. Cut circle into 6 wedges. Transfer them to a baking sheet that has either been buttered or lined with a fresh sheet of parchment paper. Leave at least 2 inches between each scone.</p>
<p>Beat remaining egg in a small bowl with a pinch of salt. Brush the scones with egg wash and sprinkle them with remaining tablespoon of sugar. Bake until firm and golden, about 30 minutes. With a spatula, lift them to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. Before you eat one, make sure you realize how addictive they might be. Once you&#8217;ve got that down, go for it anyway.</p>
<p><u>Do ahead:</u> Scones are best the day they are baked. However, they can be made ahead of time and stored unbaked in the freezer until you need them. Simply brush them with the egg wash and sprinkle them with sugar, and bake them still frozen for just a couple extra minutes. This way they are always freshly baked when you want them. These scones were passable on day two and terrible on day three. </p>

				<p>Hi there, these look great!  What kind of apples did you use?  I must admit I&#8217;m a bit of an apple newbie and generally just eat whatever looks the best.  Do you have any specific recommendations for these scones?<br />
Thanks!  :-)</p>

				<p>Karla &#8212; The recipe suggests a firm, tart apple. I used Granny Smiths. However, at least in NYC, I haven&#8217;t seen them yet. They seem to be later into fall if at all. I also like Golden Delicious for baking. Not as tart or firm, but not so juicy that you run into wetness issues.</p>

				<p>Do you think these can be flash frozen like regular scones? Do you think the apple will get gross if I freeze them before baking?</p>

				<p>These are going on the menu for breakfast tomorrow, even though I have a super easy non finicky scone recipe we all love, somehow these look worth it.  Plus there are the bags and bags of apples I could not stop picking at the orchard.</p>
<p>I hope my oldest likes them.  I made the Gourmet cheddar sour cream biscuits you recently posted and he happily ate 2 1/2 of them before asking if it was my usual recipe.  When I told him no they had cheddar in them, he said they were awful, he hated them and he felt a little sick.  OY!  Everyone else loved them all the way through.</p>

				<p>I loove freezing scones and biscuits but I do it before I bake them. They&#8217;re best on the first day. Passable but not as great on the second. Terrible on the third. I&#8217;ll update the recipe to note this.</p>

				<p>Darn it!  I just made cheddar dill scones (no lie)!  I would have rather roasted some apples and made these with that deliciously sharp aged cheddar.  It&#8217;s all about timing, I guess.  I&#8217;ll just have to send hubby to the store&#8230;.again.</p>

				<p>Thanks for the tip, not wanting a really juicy apple is definitely not something I would have considered, but now that I think of it, it makes perfect sense.  Can&#8217;t wait to try them!</p>

				<p>I remember the first time I heard about putting slices of cheddar on apple pie and thinking my friend was out of her mind (&#8220;Is that a northeast thing??&#8221;).  Since then, the pairing of apples and cheddar has grown on me, but don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve actually tried it yet.  These sound like the perfect intro to get me hooked!</p>

				<p>A scone tip I learned from America&#8217;s Test Kitchen is to freeze the stick of butter, then grate, and refreeze. When making the scones, you roll and fold a few times as if making pastry.  This makes amazingly moist, light and melt in your mouth scones &#8211; wondering if I can incorporate that here.</p>

				<p>Right, I was thinking I would bake them after freezing. But I worried about the apples because you have to semi-bake them first. I wasn&#8217;t sure if it would work out for the apples to be baked, frozen, and then baked again.</p>

				<p>Ah! Last week I made cheddar scones, and this week I made apple muffins (with your deeeelicious caramel sauce). Now I&#8217;m going to have to get back in the kitchen and make these! Which is fine, because I have a bushel of Granny Smiths sitting in my garage. Oh, and I have good luck under baking scones just a bit (just before they brown) and freezing them then.  Thaw, then finish browning in a 350 oven.  Brown and serve scones, if you will.</p>

				<p>My family is most definitely not from the northeast, but my mom used to serve us Hostess apple pies with a slice of cheddar melted on top.  It sounds iffy to me now (mostly the Hostess apple pie part), but we loved it.  I have an entire basket of empires, northern spies, and cortlands waiting to be used.  Also, I have an adjustable apple slicer that can produce either 8 or 16 even slices, depending how you set the slicer thingy.  I grumpily scoot the thing out of the way in the drawer all year long, but when apple season arrives, I&#8217;m really happy I bought it.</p>

<p>In the South, we put a slice of cheese on apple pie.  Ever heard of that?  Sometimes I make my apple pie crust with a little shredded cheddar in the dough.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb!  I plan on making this this weekend, or maybe this evening if I can&#8217;t wait!  One question: do the apple chunks get further &#8220;chunked&#8221; in the mixer?  I notice that you suggest coarsely chopping them if not using a mixer, but not if you are.  My KitchenAid isn&#8217;t very fierce on low speed, so I&#8217;m wondering if I should chop them before putting them in?</p>

				<p>I like to cut the scones but bake them without separating the wedges too much. By cutting them, they&#8217;re individual, but they don&#8217;t crisp up as much at the edges. Though, it does make them crumbly when you re-cut them.</p>

				<p>These sound DELICIOUS, definitely going to try them. Small thing &#8211; 254g comes to 9oz, definitely not 1lb. Not sure where that number came from unless maybe you halved the recipe or something?</p>

				<p>I once made an apple cheddar loaf, and wasn&#8217;t a fan at all. That one didn&#8217;t have me grate the cheese though, just pop it in in chunks. Maybe this one should get me over that, since I really do believe it&#8217;s an amazing combination, just can&#8217;t get it to work!</p>

				<p>Ok, possibly a stupid (or lazy) question, but could I just grate the apple instead of chopping/roasting/chopping? Or does the roasting bring out the apple flavor? I suppose it probably would, given the way roasting brings out the flavor of all kinds of vegetables, but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve ever tried it with apples.</p>

				<p>These look amazing! Any thoughts to lessen the calories? I do it with muffins all of the time, but scones are a bit trickier! </p>
<p>Applesauce instead of some of the butter? Do you think it could work? I worry it would seriously mess with the texture.</p>

				<p>I just recently made the drunken apple cake on Leite&#8217;s site that had no flavoring except apples and rum.  I used some jonagolds and you could actually taste them in the recipe.  Imagine, no cinnamon or nutmeg..it was a delight!  The jonagold is my new favorite apple for baking.  It holds it shape and has some sweetness like the Golden Delicious, and gets it&#8217;s slightly tart backnote from the Jonathan.  Very flavorful.   It&#8217;s like the perfect baking apple.  I still have some, so I&#8217;m going to test them on these scones.  Thanks, Deb.</p>

				<p>These look delicious! Just one thing (and I hate to nitpic), but you list the weight of your apples as 1 pound or 254 grams. I think you made a typo; a pound is 454 grams.</p>

				<p>Have you thought about adding bacon?  Last year, Burgerville (a local slow-ish fast food chain that uses a lot of locally-sourced ingredients) featured Apple Bacon Cheddar Scones on their menu.  I loved them so much I tried to recreate them at home, and they were even better.  I caramelized the apples a bit too much, but gosh they were good.  I used my favorite scone recipe as the base, from the All Around the World Cookbook by Sheila Lukins.  You can find the recipe on my blog in the December 09 archives.  And I&#8217;ll apologize in advance for the woefully un-updated state of my blog.</p>

				<p>These were the remedy to my horrible day. I halved the recipe (went on what I happened to have in the house) subbed sour cream for heavy cream, and lightly salted as well as sugared the tops before baking- and they were wonderful! My roommates were begging for more. I think I will bake these for some client meetings next week!</p>

				<p>These are in my oven now, baking for a little after dinner treat &#8211; they smell so delicious the 10 minute cooling time is going to KILL me.  </p>
<p>If I wanted to make these with whole wheat flour could I do a whole substitution or would partial be better?  I can never figure out if the gluten content will be vastly different&#8230; thoughts?</p>

				<p>Another baking recipe that went straight to the printer and will be served up for lunch tomorrow (only because it&#8217;s now afternoon here). If they last as long as the mollasses ginger cookies let&#8217;s just say they won&#8217;t go stale.  Thinking of a spicy tomato soup to go with them.</p>

				<p>I have sooo many fresh, organic apples right now and although I need to tweak your tweak and make these gluten-free, that shouldn&#8217;t be much of a problem. These scones sound delicious and you&#8217;ve inspired me to take on adapting the recipe to gluten-free. Can&#8217;t wait. Off to the kitchen right now! Thanks!<br />

				<p>I read this post, got in my car and drove to Whole Foods for apples, returned home and immediately made these scones.  So good &#8230; so very very good.  </p>
<p>I check in here every day and almost never post but I do want to take a moment to tell you that I have made many of the recipes posted here and greatly enjoyed virtually every one.  I should have said thanks for both the recipes and the inspiration to get cooking before now. So thanks!</p>

				<p>Hey Deb,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t what I like most about your website the food or the writing.  Both make me smile out loud (if that exists) regularly.  Don&#8217;t know about apples and cheddar thow.   I&#8217;m from Bruxelles in Belgium and this combo is not so common here.     We&#8217;ll give it a go one of the coming weeks as I went a bit overboard last week picking my own apples on a farm nearby.</p>

				<p>I never understood the apple and cheddar thing.  Apple pie and ice cream?  Or cream?  Yep, I get it.  But not cheddar.  I made these, though, because I actually had all of the ingredients, and I had never made scones before.</p>
<p>Yum.  They were very, very good.  And for those of you who aren&#8217;t too sure about the combination, the cheddar is far from overwhelming; it is definitely not the the dominant flavor.  Thanks, Deb, for another yummy (and easy) recipe.</p>

				<p>Just taken a batch out of the oven and they are delicious, you&#8217;re right about them being more-ish! My batter was far too wet to roll out (I swapped half the butter for oil, which might have something to di with it&#8230;) so I just dolloped it on the tray in 8 portions and although a little lumpy looking they still taste great! Might cover the tops with cheese next time too, yum!</p>

				<p>will have to try these&#8230;i like the technique of roasting the apples&#8230;<br />
so the apples will still have a bit of crunch to them&#8230;that&#8217;s nice&#8230;<br />
but what is even nicer &amp; oh so sweet is the &#8220;31 seconds&#8221; of your jacob in the pumpkin patch! thanks for sharing!</p>

				<p>Baked these this morning with Staymen apples we picked 2 weeks ago.  They went into a towel lined basket right out of the oven and an hour later at the pumpkin farm they were still warm.   Everyone loved them, especially my 17 month old. Thank you!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m a bit puzzled as to this:</p>
<p>&#8220;2 firm tart apples (1 pound or 254 grams)&#8221;</p>
<p>A pound is approximately 450 grams, so&#8230; Well, let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;m unclear as to what the are you trying say here.</p>

				<p>I have just registered with this site and the Apple and Cheddar Scones were the first recipe I received an alert sbout.  I had all the ingredients, so went straight ahead.  Absolutely delicious!  We ate them with butter and more Cheddar &#8211; yum!  As I live in the UK I am so glad you do all the conversions of weights and temperatures already.  I look forward to the next recipe.</p>

				<p>For all those gluten free readers &#8211; Gluten Free Girl and the Chef have come up with a foolproof substitute mix (and yes, it really is foolproof. . .sea level, high altitude, hot weather, cold weather, sweets, savouries. . .). I&#8217;ve been using it for months in everything and have yet to find a recipe it fails in &#8211; my last batch of scones even flaked! The trick is in the ratio: 40% flour, 60% starch. Any flour, any starch, any combination. They say to substitute 140g per cup in gluten recipes, but I&#8217;ve had no problems substituting g for g. Add a teaspoon of xanthan gum or guar gum per 200g to improve your texture. . .</p>

				<p>I just made these, and the only thing I disliked was how much time I had to wait for them.  Also that I ended up using my fingers to mix together the dough because my mixer was too fast, and the pastry cutter kept getting stuck on apples.  I wasn&#8217;t sure if the somewhat still large-ish chunks of butter needed to be mixed in more or not, but I ended up just going with it.  I baked half of them and put the others in the freezer.</p>
<p>I was wondering, when you freeze yours, how do you store them?</p>

				<p>Oh, Deb, I just bit into my first apple cheddar scone and am in LOVE!  OH. MY. GOODNESS.<br />
A couple things I did slightly differently, first I used yellow cheddar- as God and Wisconsin intended it to be!  :)  Then, I had some turbinado sugar left from a delectable recipe for blueberry/peach cobbler out of Cooking Light magazine.  The larger slightly crunchy sugar pebbles are really good!  And sort of shiny and pebbly and pretty.  Thank you for this recipe!!  I bought an electronic scale last weekend and I busted it out for this.  I feel like such a big girl, though I have been baking for 40 years&#8230; ;D</p>

				<p>My husband&#8217;s daily post-work ritual involves eating a snack of an apple and cheddar cheese so I could not resist making this recipe the moment I saw the title. I do not have a standing mixer but used my food processor to mix the dry ingredients and cut the butter into the flour mixture (I do the same for pie crusts). I then put the mixture into a bowl, added the rest of the ingredients and gently brought them all together by hand. They are delicious and will be thoroughly enjoyed on our beach picnic! Thanks for sharing all the lovely pictures and yummy recipes.</p>

				<p>I have these babies in the oven as we speak! The only problem I had was that my apples nearly burned in the oven after only 13 minutes..maybe because I used Honey Crisp apples (which, if you haven&#8217;t had, are the BEST apples for baking EVER!)? They looked fine from the top but the bottoms were almost black. I had extra, so it wasn&#8217;t a big deal. Can&#8217;t wait to try them!</p>

				<p>I have a favorite recipe for cheddar scones but I have never thought of apple cheddar scones. These look amazing! I&#8217;m an apple freak in the fall, when I compulsively add them to everything, including soup. Now I will add them to my scones. Thanks for posting this.</p>

				<p>Tried these today&#8230;.delicious!   I used 2% milk, and a 2% chedder blend and they were ( note: &#8220;were&#8221;) really good. I  Will definitely make them again.</p>

				<p>Just pulled these beauties out of the oven 10 minutes ago.  I tried one, and it was awesome!!  Thanks for the post.  By the way, it&#8217;s my baking day so my eggs are precious commodities at this point.  I didn&#8217;t want to use one up for an egg wash, so I brushed some cream on them instead.  It worked great!</p>

				<p>I just made these, and even though I messed up they were fantastic!  I dumped out the dough, and thought it looked a little dry.  Looked around the kitchen and realized I had not opened the carton of eggs.  Everything back in the mixed, looked at the ingredients, and added both eggs (did not actually read the recipe).  Gave it a quick mix, and now it was super loose dough because of the extra egg.  So, even though it was a little work to put them on the tray without a mess, they were still mighty tasty.  I used salt on top instead of sugar because I knew I was eating them for dinner.  I split one open, swiped on some mustard, and added a few pieces of ham.  With a salad, it was a great dinner.</p>

				<p>If any of you out there have kitchens that tend to get warm like mine (especially when you&#8217;ve already had the oven on for a while to bake the apples), I&#8217;d recommend giving these a few minutes in the freezer/fridge once they&#8217;re on the sheet pan before baking.  Mine turned out a bit misshapen, I think because the butter melted before they had time to set up, and the uneven thickness made it hard to get them evenly cooked.  (I even put the cubed butter in the freezer for about 20 minutes before mixing!)  </p>
<p>However, don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m not eating them, because they&#8217;re delicious!</p>

				<p>is the dough supposed to be like cake batter? i&#8217;ve checked and double checked that i used all the correct measurements. i&#8217;m confused. maybe it&#8217;s because i&#8217;ve never made scones before?</p>

				<p>I just made these along with the roasted eggplant soup for dinner.  Definitely a hit with my husband.  His comment &#8211; &#8220;You would never know there was eggplant in this soup.&#8221; Perfect! (I added the cumin, coriander and red pepper flakes &#8211; I think I will add more red pepper next time).  The scones will definitely become one of my go-to recipes.  In fact, I think I will be making a second batch tomorrow.  The perfect way to warm up a chilly Alaskan day.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>Tried these today, and they were *wonderful*! Thanks for the tip on refrigerating the semi-baked apples to cool them down. Also, good advice to not overmix &#8211; I could feel how light the dough was as I was transferring the sliced scones from the counter to the baking pan. We also took your advice to eat them all on baking day!</p>

				<p>I made these tonight to go with a smoky lentil soup. The combination was delicious! My scone dough was not as pretty as yours&#8230;and the scones themselves were a little odd looking. I think I may have overmixed the dough and they could have used a bit more flour&#8230;but they were absolutely delicious.<br />
Thank you!</p>

				<p>I made these last night to take to dinner at my in-laws. I only had super-ripe red delicious apples on hand that I really needed to use up, so the dough came out a little more juicy.  I just added a bit more flour to compensate. They were delicious!</p>

				<p>I absolutely heart the combination of apples and cheese, but I&#8217;ve never been big on scones.  This is probably because of the hardened bricks that starbucks sells.  They are not good.</p>
<p>So I made these on a whim last night, since I had a few friends coming over, and was astounded.  So very good.  I made a double batch and froze half to bake another time, but ended up baking those for breakfast today.  I&#8217;ll have to go for a nice, long run!</p>

				<p>Yum.  I even converted my scone-skeptical boyfriend with my gluten-free version of these.  (Substituted a rice flour/potato starch/tapioca blend and added 1 tsp of xanthan gum).  So delicious.  And LIGHT &#8212; I think my rice flour base added to the general levity.</p>

				<p>I love Smitten Kitchen! It&#8217;s become a real go-to when I need a great recipe! I&#8217;m finally de-lurking to ask a question. I loooove apples and cheddar, so I&#8217;d love to make these, but I&#8217;m not a big fan of big cunks of fruit in my scones. How would you recommend I go about making this with shredded apples? Would it be better to just use freshly shredded apples or should I still try to roast them somehow?<br />
Thanks!</p>

				<p>i just made them! delicious. my friends said they are the best scones they ever ate. we had only macintosh apples and i used them, they were good. i followed the recipe as written (except doubled it) but i think next time i would use Louise&#8217;s comment (#18) re: the freezing and grating the butter. it would have been much easier to mix the whole thing without a lot of mess. but these were amazing.</p>

				<p>I am loving the cheddar cheese and apple combo. And thanks for the note from those of us who don&#8217;t have a stand mixer!</p>

				<p>Yum. I have never paired apple and cheddar having been more afraid of it than enticed by the concept but these are truly delicious. My kitchen smells of baking cheddar. I thought it was a little strange that the chunks of butter were still so big &#8211; following the directions to lightly mix just until it comes together. And in fact, it turned out just great.</p>

				<p>Thank you for this recipie, I made these to go with a creamy souffle, they were very good, but perhaps a little bland as my chedder was pretty unexciting, i might add a pinch of paprika next time or a few cranberries, or goats cheese or&#8230;&#8230;</p>

				<p>Thanks for posting this recipe! I made a half batch of these on the weekend and would definitely make them again! The taste was good, but my dough looked nothing like your photo. I was too afraid of overmixing! Not only that but I cut my apples into 32s by accident and used the large grate. (I should have looked at your photos before baking!! BWAHAHAA)</p>

				<p>@Stephanie: You might be able to toast the grated apple? Spread it out over a baking pan with some parchment paper and stick it in the oven for just a few minutes. It should have the same effect as roasting the chunked apples if you don&#8217;t leave them in too long (ie you don&#8217;t want the shreds to dry out too much or to burn, obviously).</p>

				<p>YUMMY! made these this weekend and they were heavenly. it was my first endeavor to making scones but these came out beautifully. i ended up cutting them into 10 pieces instead of 6 and they are the perfect size. next batch I&#8217;ll probably make even smaller so they&#8217;re bite size and easy to eat on the run. if you haven&#8217;t made these, you should!</p>

				<p>This is my first comment to Smitten Kitchen! I love the site and the recipes. We had a cool, rainy Sunday here in Colorado and I had planned these scones. Had all the ingredients so whipped them up. Oh my goodness, they were delicious. Thank you soooo much. I like the suggestion in the comments about adding bacon. Next time.</p>

				<p>I loooove apples and cheddar. Especially in a crepe or melted on ciabatta (add ham too!)&#8230; mmmmmm.  Anyway, I made this recipe right away of course and they are SO yummy!  The sugary crust really makes a huge difference in the overall flavor.  The only thing I would do differently is mash the apples up a bit before combining them with everything else.  Maybe it&#8217;s just because I used a hand mixer instead of a stand mixer, but if I hadn&#8217;t sought out each apple piece and intentionally smashed it with the blenders I would have had huge chunks throughout.  Like others said though, do leave some good sized chunks. You don&#8217;t want it totally pureed.</p>

				<p>Delish! I just ate the first one still warm and it&#8217;s definitely hard not to eat a second! I made them with whole wheat flour &#8211; added just a splash of extra cream &#8211; but they were still melt-in-your-mouth fabulous and, perhaps, a teensy weensy bit healthier for you?! Thanks for another great recipe!</p>

				<p>Amazing.  I made the batter on Sunday, cut it into wedges, and froze in bags of 2.  Popped 2 in the oven for dinner tonight and they came out perfectly.  Best baked good I have ever made.  The fact that the rest are still frozen kept us from eating all of them.  Thanks for the recipe.</p>

				<p>Hello!<br />
(Long-time drooler, first-time commenter.)<br />
I made these yesterday. The flavours are indeed beautifully paired, but I did run into wetness issues.<br />
Perhaps I used too much apple, or was a bit too lax on the measurements in general (highly likely: my pah!-attention-to-detail-schmetail nature is probably responsible for a fairly high rate of baking failure), but I ended up having to add a heap of flour just so I wasn&#8217;t working with glue, and pretty much plopping them individually onto the board to work into something that resembled scone-shape.<br />
I feel so disappointed when my baking attempts go awry!<br />
Lesson of the day: an enthusiatic, gun-ho attitude does not always apply itself well in the kitchen, especially where baking is concerned. The devil&#8217;s in the details, Claire.<br />
Deb I am firmly obsessed with your blog. And I think it has been responsible for igniting my obsession with taking photos of anything myself/friends/scared strangers are eating! Thank you.<br />
PS. We shall overcome! There will be a glorious baked something-or-other produced by the end of the this week, I&#8217;ll see to it!</p>

				<p>Deb, OMG&#8230;these were soooo good.  My husband ate THREE all by himself.  He had no clue what a scone was (UGH&#8230;raised by wolves I guess).  Now he wants me to make them every weekend.  He says they are a good carb and gives him lots of energy when he weight trains.   I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s worse&#8230;this recipe or your pumpkin pie recipe (you know, the one that you use both pumpkin and yams?!).  My husband was bugging me to make a pumpkin pie in the dead of summer.  Thank God they don&#8217;t sell canned pumpkin then or else I would have been baking all summer long!  ;)</p>

				<p>I made these last night as a midnight snack/pre made breakfast. I didn&#8217;t like them at first-they were way too dense. But this morning I ended up eating 4 more without realizing it. I&#8217;m stuffed and satisfied :) Thanks!</p>
<p>PS- I sprinkled more cheese on top and it got deliciously crispy. Yum.</p>

				<p>Yup.  Made 2 batches.  Had one for breakfast (and almost had to physically restrain myself from grabbing more).  Cut them in half and brought them to the potluck and they were gone within 45 minutes.  Success!</p>
<p>Also I remembered to do the egg wash but forgot the sugar sprinkle&#8230;oh well!  Guess I&#8217;ll just have to make them again :)</p>

				<p>I love scones, however I have never had apple cheddar scones.  Growing up my sisters and I would eat pounds of apple slices with a piece of sharp cheddar on each slice.  I definitely think these scones would be a big hit for Thanksgiving!  Thank you!</p>

				<p>I just got back from Apple hill and I think we purchased about 100 pounds of apples (im not kidding or crazy its really cheap there) and we don&#8217;t know what to do, we have done all the classics, I like this because it&#8217;s something a bit more savory, thank you!</p>

				<p>confession number one. i love scones. confession number two. my favorite late night creperie treat features baked apples and cheddar.<br />
my mouth is literally watering right now. this is like two of my favorite food indulgences combined and i cannot WAIT to try these!!<br />
though i have only attempted scones once before&#8230;and they were a bit finicky and so i won&#8217;t lie, i&#8217;m a bit apprehensive to attempt scone dough again. it seems like a balance between delicacy and being the boss. my dough kind of became the boss last time&#8230;and then after all that time and effort and frustration i took them to a work meeting&#8230;and left them on a curb in the parking lot for a few minutes while we grabbed supplies. and, well, when i came back a swarm of crows had attacked the tray, leaving shreds of plastic wrap and crumbs of my sad blueberry scones on the asphalt.</p>
<p>lesson learned: do not leave hard earned scones on a curb in the parking lot. ever.</p>
<p>thank you for this little gem! so excited to bake some scones&#8230;i can smell them now.</p>

				<p>Yay! These tasted amazing. Except for the part where my totally unreliable oven burned the bottoms.  But they were too delicious to throw away, so we just cut the bottoms off.  Presentation wasn&#8217;t the greatest but they still tasted great!</p>
<p>And, I made them with 1/4 c nonfat plain yogurt instead of the cream.  It worked wonderfully!</p>

				<p>Made these this past weekend and they are definitely gush-worthy.  I knew they&#8217;d be excellent based on your enthusiasm and the fact that they&#8217;re based on a recipe from The Perfect Finish.  The Plum Galette from that book is out of this world!</p>

				<p>Claire and others that have been concerned about the sticky dough &#8212; Yup, it is correctly a sticky dough. The best thing to do is not to fight it or add flour to it (which will make them as dry and stiff as those nightmares you can buy at coffee shops) but to toss a lot of flour onto your counter, throw the dough on top, flour the top of it and pat or roll it out in as few motions as possible so not to disturb the flour underneath and allow the dough to stick. Use a spatula to transfer them (or your fingers, if you think you can do so quickly) and you can brush off any excessive excess (can you use these two words together?) flour before you brush and bake them. That soft dough makes a wonderfully light, moist and shaggy scone. Embrace it. Hope that helps.</p>

				<p>so basically i had to make these as soon as i read the recipe.  i too am not always a fan of apple and cheddar combos, but i had a feeling when you said you loved them that maybe i might too.  and as luck would have it, i had almost everything on hand to make them, so horray!<br />
roasting the apples wasn&#8217;t that annoying, and it definitely gave me ideas about other fruit scones that might need some roasting before baking (to reduce water?).  i used half and half because i didn&#8217;t have cream, and actually only had one egg, so i &#8220;washed&#8221; the scones with half and half instead.  they turned out beautifully.  my fiance was skeptical but said he would try them, and even he was won over.<br />
another hit deb &#8211; thanks!</p>

				<p>rose &#8212; My guess is that the apples are roasted first because the short baking time wouldn&#8217;t be enough to cook them. Plus, chunks of cooked apples are always fun to find in a scone!</p>

				<p>These scones look so good (I come from a scone devouring family).  I love fall cooking all around and the pastries are no exception.  I saw a recipe the other day for a pumpkin and feta muffin that looked so good I wanted to cry.  This delicious looking munchy has achieved the same result.  There is a great farmer&#8217;s market near where I live too that has some of the best apples that will be perfect for this.  And I went to Washington State University where they make a delicious cheese and I&#8217;m due for a visit.</p>

				<p>Made these last Sunday and they were delicious. Our local grocery was having a cheese festival and had some really good 15 month old white cheddar. It was perfect for this recipe. I will definitely be making these again. They were pretty easy and quick too considering the exta step of roasting the apples. thanks.</p>

				<p>Hi!!  I&#8217;m a new reader, feeling so grateful I found your blog.  I have a huge pile of recipe printouts already!!  This is the second recipe I&#8217;ve tried, with yummy success (the grape focaccia was to die-for!!  I need to search for an adequate replacement for concord grapes because I simply can&#8217;t imagine waiting until they&#8217;re back in season to make that again!)<br />
Just made these scones this evening and am in heaven after sitting down with a chai latte and a warm scone.  My husband just keeps looking for more in the kitchen!  (I froze 3 and baked 3 &#8211; not telling him about the ones in the freezer&#8230;)  I actually cut and roasted the apples On Sunday, but ran out of time before soccer to bake them.  They&#8217;ve been in the fridge since then and it didn&#8217;t seem to matter at all.  I used 2 fairly large granny smiths, cut into 16 pieces.  I was wondering though &#8211; was I supposed to cream the butter, apples, etc before adding the flour mixture?  I didn&#8217;t have trouble with the dough &#8211; I did it exactly a you described in a comment above, just sprinkling with flour and handling as little as possible.  But even after mixing in the mixer, the apple pieces still seemed so huge.  I actually had to almost force the dough all together &#8211; it sure didn&#8217;t look close to as smooth as your photo above.  Mind you &#8211; I loved the apple chunks in the finished product, but was just wondering.<br />
I also didn&#8217;t notice a very strong cheddar flavor.  I grated the cheese (which was just sharp cheddar from Trader Joe&#8217;s) using the larger holes on a box grater.  Next time (oh, there&#8217;ll be many mores next times!) I&#8217;m going to try using a finer grate and a stronger cheddar.<br />
Thanks so much!!  Tonight I make my grocery list for the roasted eggplant soup.  Can&#8217;t wait!</p>

				<p>These were just delicious. I was a little worried about the size of the apple pieces, so cut each (large) Spygold apple into 32 pieces. Roasted them for the full 20 minutes. Just barely mixed the dough and they turned out perfectly. I think next time I will make smaller scones, though, maybe making two smaller rounds and cutting each into fourths or sixths. I served them to my new neighbor, who had never had a scone, and she raved about them. Thanks so much for the recipe!</p>

				<p>I made these yesterday using shredded apples and they were fantastic! I shredded the apples, then roasted them for about 7 minutes, just to dry them out so the dough wouldn&#8217;t get too wet. I didn&#8217;t have any problems with a too-sticky dough, but I wonder if it&#8217;s because I used sour cream instead of cream. I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.<br />
These were so delicious! Just the right balance between salty and sweet with a craggy crust and a moist, soft inside.<br />
I&#8217;m planning on making them again this weekend when my in-laws come in town. Thanks so much, Deb!</p>

				<p>I tried it with a mix of half apples, half pears, and it was delish!  Such a nice breakfast treat.  The 3 year old even ate one without complaint.</p>

				<p>I can never, ever make these again &#8211; EVER. Why? Because I ate them all in two days (my fiance helped and ate one). Seriously, these are incredible &#8211; the cheddar apple combo is tart and amazing and everything I needed on these two chilly, rainy October days. The texture was perfect and the cheddar flavor was not intense &#8211; the scones were not too dry, not too dense (hey, I made a rhyme!). I used 3 apples, not 2 (they were pretty small green delicious apples) but followed everything else as suggested. I used regular sharp cheddar, not white (I had a ton of regular sharp cheddar in the fridge just waiting for a home) and it was fine and didn&#8217;t even look weird.</p>

				<p>Love love love these scones.  I should have used either more cheese or sharper cheese or both, but they are still delicious!  Instead of an egg wash (out of pure laziness), I just dabbed some more cream on them and then sprinkled the sugar.  They came out great and I definitely know how I want to tweak this recipe next time.   My dough was pretty dry for some reason, but I just used a biscuit cutter &#8211; I said, hey if the dough is dry enough, why not make them look pretty! When they were done, they weren&#8217;t dry at all, a little biscuit-y though.  I had to do this by hand with my pastry blender, maybe that had something to do with it. Also, I only cooked them for 15 mins.. Not sure why mine were so different, but it doesn&#8217;t matter because I love em.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>Made these this morning before work to include in a care package for a coworker.  I made a double batch so we could enjoy some at home too.  I flash froze 4/6 of each batch, and baked the other 2/6.    The house smelled amazing and my &#8220;test&#8221; scone was delicious!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m eating my freshly-baked scone this very moment, and it is TO DIE FOR.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, Deb!  Love you so much!  I&#8217;d also like to comment to #235-the idea of a scotch + dulce de leche ice cream added to these golden crags of deliciousness would probably push me over the proverbial edge.</p>

				<p>I am going to go against the grain and say these were just so-so.  The dough mixed up well and the scones looked just like your picture. The scone was good in texture but really lacked flavor.  I used Criterion and Golden Delicious apples that we picked the day before and a heaping half cup of sharp cheddar.  I probably won&#8217;t make these again.</p>

				<p>I sometimes wish that my sister-in-law had never introduced me to your website however, those thoughts never last for long!  You&#8217;re killing my diet but your recipes are just too good to not try.  I love baking but having moved over here from England (where the flour is all different) I find a lot of my old recipes don&#8217;t work.  Your website is such a joy because now I can bake again, knowing that the recipes will be successful!!  These scones are heavenly and now I&#8217;m glad I picked so many apples two weekends ago &#8216;cos I get to make these again&#8230;..and again&#8230;..and again!  Thank you!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb! I&#8217;ve been a fan for a few years now, but hardly ever post&#8230;until this morning when I made these scones for my family! Everyone loved them. The crispy exterior and soft-fluffy inside made for a perfect scone texture. The apple-cheddar mix was great, but seeing how I used Gala apples (only ones we had); I did find them a little on the sweet side, which may have been a little over-powering to the cheddar. Also, I used 1% milk instead of cream. I don&#8217;t know if the texture would have been different with the cream, but regardless they were devoured alongside our egg and tomato-baked bean breakfast! </p>
<p>Thanks for the great recipe (I&#8217;ll be making these again) and blog site! Smitten Kitchen is one of my go-to sources for culinary inspiration. :)</p>

				<p>OMG!!!  These are amazing!  I used 2 1/2 med honeycrisp apples.  Took from Cook&#8217;s Illustrated and used the food processor to incorporate the cold butter into the flour mixture and then poured everything into a bowl and incorporated the cream, egg, cheese and apples gently with a wooden spoon.  Patted the dough into and circle and made 8 scones.  Baked as instructed and these beauties came out most fantastically!!!  ENJOY!</p>

				<p>Yum! Just made these and they were amazing and as addictive as you said.  I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream and maragarine instead of butter (i&#8217;m too poor :( ) but they still tasted divine. I&#8217;m so glad it&#8217;s apple season!</p>

				<p>Made these last week and they were absolutely fantastic and so easy to make. Decided to make them for my daughter&#8217;s first birthday party next week, so I doubled the recipe last night and made a large batch to freeze. They were a disaster. No idea why &#8212; the dough was far wetter than last time. I added a bit more flour but was worried about over-mixing. They&#8217;re in the freezer now, but they look terrible. I will try baking a couple this week to see if they taste the same, but I wondered if doubling the recipe caused my problems or if I just had bad luck?</p>

				<p>i too eat my second scone as I read the comments and type.  I want to eat another, but will practice the self control that you mentioned was needed!  The scones are very good.  At first I was a bit irked also to have to bake the apples prior, but it  adds a lot of flavor and half baked apples taste pretty good on their own.  I think the scones would be great with a little onion in the batter, to make them more savory.  Or maybe with a few scallions cut up.  Thanks to the reader who mentioned that whole wheat pastry flour works well.  Will do that next time also.  Love to use whole wheat whenever possible.  Thank you Debbie for the blog and the photos of possibly the cutest baby in NYC!  He needs an agent&#8230;</p>

				<p>Loved these&#8211;I want to throw a brunch just to have a reason to make these for company!  We, too, have tons of apples from a trip to the apple orchard and this was the perfect way to use them up.  I made the dough the night before and baked them fresh for breakfast this morning&#8211;my kids and husband went nuts!<br />
I am glad to see that people used yellow cheddar; I had to go to 2 stores to find white, and it was significantly more expensive than the lovely orange sharp cheddar right next to it!  I&#8217;ll try orange next time.  Thanks so much for these!</p>

				<p>Just made these today &#8211; absolutely delicious!  I don&#8217;t have the stand-mixer, so I used a pastry blender ($10 at my local kitchen store) and found that hand-mixing changed the way I need to add things together a bit.  I roasted the apples (cut them smaller than recommended since the hand-mixing would keep the pieces intact) and let them cool, and set my flour mixture aside in a bowl.  Then in a separate bowl I beat the egg and added the cream and the cheese and cooled apples to that, setting it aside.  Used the pastry blender to combine the flour and chilled butter pieces, then poured the flour/butter mixture over the egg/cream/cheese/apple mixture and used a dough whisk to mix until just incorporated.  I cut and froze the scones the night before and they turned out great.  I used coarse Hawaiian sugar for sprinkling &#8211; very nice!  I will be making these again and again, I am sure.</p>

				<p>LOVE scones, and these were wonderful! Thanks for the recipe. I think next time I will drastically reduce (if include at all) the sugar and add some spice (thyme, rosemary, something) to make a savory scone and let the apple be the sweet. Thanks!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made these twice, and they are wonderful.  1st time I think I added more apple and cheese and kept thick, and they looked pretty wet during the baking-but ended up fabulous.  Yesterday I baked em by the book-a bit thinner.  Either way, you really do think alot about them&#8230;before, during &amp; after.  Better than..oh, you know&#8230;!</p>

				<p>These were the first scones I&#8217;d ever made, and I had to call my Much More Experienced Than I Baker Friend to make sure a sticky, gooey dough was what I was supposed to get. They turned out amazing! I made them a day ahead of when I needed them, freezed them raw on my cooking trays, and baked them up late last Wednesday for a Bible study. Leftovers (there weren&#8217;t many!) kept in Tupperware and were delicious the next morning, likely because they were cooked so late the night before.</p>
<p>When I make these again, I&#8217;m going to use a much stronger cheddar. I used a sharp white and added a little more than was called for and could still hardly taste it. The SMELL of cheddar was strong with the scones, but in the scone itself the cheddar seemed to do nothing more than make the dough savory rather than sweet. I wouldn&#8217;t add more cheddar to the batter, since my scones were already evidencing the browned bottoms that only toasted cheese can produce, so I think strong, strong cheddar is the way to go. I&#8217;ve heard Tillamook Black label is pretty good&#8230;</p>

				<p>These were the first scones I&#8217;ve ever made, and I was disappointed.  I&#8217;m sure I must have done something wrong, but not sure what.  My dough came out way too sticky and gooey&#8230;.after beating them far more than I think was intended (several minutes), the dough still didn&#8217;t seem to have &#8220;come together.&#8221;  Dumped it out on the counter to pat into a circle, and added more flour then in an attempt to get it to a state where I could cut it into triangles (still didn&#8217;t really work), but the dough was still so soft and oozy that the scones didn&#8217;t hold their form and spread out a lot while baking.  Still tasted pretty good, but definitely not the right texture.</p>

				<p>Do you remember by chance about how long the whole process took you?  I&#8217;m thinking how great these would be for breakfast with the family and am trying to guess how early i need to get up before the house awakens!  :)</p>

				<p>Sara, you should make and shape and cut the dough the night before and freeze or refrigerate over night.   Take them out when you pre-heat the oven and coat with the egg wash and sugar, then bake (add a few more minutes if they are frozen).  </p>
<p>It took me less than 60 minutes to make the dough which included: 20minutes to bake the apples, 10 minutes to cool the apples in the fridge another 20 minutes or so to mix and shape.</p>

				<p>These scones were very good and I don&#8217;t particularly like scones.  Scones tend to be dry and dense.  These were neither.  However I would change the recipe a little.  The apples should be cut to the size you want them to be in the scone.  I also used the technique of freezing the butter and grating it.  I think it helped the dough be a little less gooey.  Since I had to run out of the house for an hour I cut the dough and refrigerated it and cooked them when I got home.  Everyone liked them.<br />
I tried another batch (double) last night without cheese but I had cooked the apples the night before and since I prefer the American sweeter pastries cooked them with some sugar and a little cinnamon and sugar in the dough.  I think I probably over worked the dough it was pretty gooey.  The pastry came out tasty but they weren&#8217;t really scones.<br />
Now that I know I can make scones and they can taste good I will try different combinations.  Thanks Debbie for helping me to be daring.</p>

				<p>I want to make these for a crowd for a post-Thanksgiving brunch.  Do you think the apples should be cut smaller for mini scones?  Chop smaller pieces to begin with and roast, or maybe follow the first part of the recipe and chop each one-sixteenth a few times after roasting?  Thanks!</p>

				<p>My husband is a lifelong scone hater, but he completely gobbled these up and said they had changed his mind about scones.  Great texture without being too dry, and the apples are lovely.  Also, Louise&#8217;s suggestion to grate the frozen butter has totally changed my life!  They came together beautifully and I didn&#8217;t have to overmix them to incorporate the butter &#8211; perfect!  I froze some to bake later and I&#8217;m already dying to take them out of the freezer!</p>

				<p>These are amazing &#8211; just enough sweet and with just the perfect amount of cheddar in the background.  I made these yesterday and already have plans for a second (and third, and fourth) batch.  </p>
<p>Sidebar: my very dear, very English husband was quite concerned that these are even called scones (Cheddar?!  In a scone?!  My darling, I don&#8217;t know about this.  *grumbles* They aren&#8217;t even properly round&#8230;) which was simply exacerbated by Mark Bittman&#8217;s very properly round scone in the NY Times a week or so ago.  But, as he has learned to appreciate left sided road rolling and chilled beer, so too was he wooed by these bad boys.  Take that as some inspiration for truly awesome pastry.</p>

				<p>These are spectacular.  I consider my scones some of THE BEST out there.  But I can tell just by the pics that these are NICE scones.  You&#8217;re right about pastry chefs &#8211; we get kinda fussy about measurements.  But then, it isn&#8217;t rocket science!</p>

				<p>Made these this morning, with my three year old helpin gme, and they were delicious &#8211; took much less time to cook than you suggested though, and yes I did check the oven temperature. Not sure why but no harm done.</p>
<p>One quick thing &#8211; I wanted to thank you for putting weights in your recipes rather than just cups etc as most american sites do. Made it so easy for us to follow. But on eg baking powder and tiny weigts like that, even us brits use teaspoons. 1/2 a table spoon is not a measure I have &#8211; is it common in the US? Luckily I know that 3tsp=1tbsp so I just did 1 and a 1/2 tsps. But interested to know how you measure this when you are cooking.</p>
<p>Thanks again, off to make my second batch!</p>

				<p>Long time recipe stealer, first time recipe obsession rave:<br />
I made these scones for a Sunday brunch using a really nice (ridiculously expensive bah!) Avondale Cheddar, and some crisp Braeburn apples.<br />
I tried my darndest to stick to the recipe exactly but I can never seem to do that, and used golden yellow sugar instead of white, because i like the depth of flavour in darker sugars, and also used about 1 cup of grated cheddar (seemed scant 1/2 cup..)<br />
Anyway, they turned out delicious and I&#8217;m so grateful for your recipes, your site is always the first place I head to for inspiration in the kitchen. Thank you!</p>

				<p>I doubled the recipe, made the dough on Wednesday and froze until Saturday morning. I baked them about 34 minutes, switching the top tray to the bottom half way through the baking time. One of the best scones I&#8217;ve ever had! I was nervous that the apple chunks seemed too large and the butter didn&#8217;t get 100% fully integrated, but neither issue was a problem at all in the end! Yum!!</p>

				<p>I made these for the second time last night and would like to say they are equally delicious if you half the sugar in the dough and don&#8217;t add any to the top, and add one small onion, diced and caramelized. It&#8217;s a bit more savory, but still awesome.</p>

I&#8217;ve always been unsure of my skills when it comes to cooking, but your easy directions and inspiring photos encouraged me to be bold :). I made these scones and they turned out SO amazing!! It made me feel good about my beginner&#8217;s skills&#8230;and now I&#8217;m in the kitchen as much as possible! Thanks!!</p>

				<p>Deb, I have made these four times now. Doubling the recipe the first few times and tripling the recipe the fourth time. They turn out fantastic too if frozen. I plan to make a huge batch this afternoon and freeze them for later use.</p>
<p>One question: have you ever tried grating frozen butter rather than dicing for this recipe? America&#8217;s Test Kitchen suggests that method for some of their scones, and I plan on trying it today.</p>

				<p>These scones were FABULOUS. I used a mix of apples and froze them. I actually thought they could use a touch more salt, and maybe even a sprinkle of cinnamon &#8212; that might tie together the sweet/savory combo.</p>
<p>Lindsay, for good measure, I diced the butter up and froze it before mixing. As a result, when I used the mixer to bring everything together, I was left with huge chunks of frozen butter that I could not incorporate into the batter without risking overworking it all. I was really worried about overworking the batter, which was incredibly sticky/wet, so I went ahead and baked the scones. I was so surprised that the large chunks of butter didn&#8217;t hurt in the slightest &#8212; the texture of the scone was perfect. I&#8217;ll be curious how your scones turn out with the grating technique.</p>
<p>Any suggestions for upping the &#8220;health&#8221; factor of these scones? These would make amazing breakfast treats if the fat content wasn&#8217;t so high. I was thinking of replacing the flour with a mix of whole wheat pastry flour and finely ground oats (this substitution works wonders in quickbread recipes). Think I could swap out the cream with milk or buttermilk?</p>

				<p>Deb,</p>
<p>I love your blog. I decided to make these this morning on a lark, and I hand mixed them since I don&#8217;t have a mixer. But the dough came out super-sloppy and unworkable, even after adding a ton of flour! Did I do something wrong?</p>

				<p>Wonderful recipe. Even better when the apples come right off your own trees :) Only mistake I made, which I will correct the next time, is having a bit too much flour on the butcher block.</p>
<p>Michelle, re:sloppy dough, yup, its kinda supposed to be that way. One of the reasons you put a bit of flour on the counter, and sprinkle on top, so you can form your &#8220;patty.&#8221; Also, heed the directions on not mixing it too much!</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t have a mixer, so I &#8220;hand&#8221; made the dough.  These were so delicious!!  Very easy recipe, and possibly my favorite thing I&#8217;ve made from smitten kitchen.  I can&#8217;t wait until I visit home for Christmas and can make these for my mother, who puts cheese slices on her apple pie.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m another convert to these scones :-)  These came together perfectly.  I&#8217;ve made them three times, and everyone loves them!  The first time I made them I was visiting a friend who didn&#8217;t have a mixer, and the dough came together so well with a pastry cutter that I&#8217;ve used this method since.  And I love that in this cool weather I can just put the tray of half-baked apples outside, and they&#8217;re perfectly chilled by the time I&#8217;ve cut the butter into the flour and grated the cheese :-)  Also, I used a biscuit cutter instead of making the six triangles, and the recipe made 8-9 biscuits, which baked in about 25 min, if anyone wants a variation (or just more scones&#8230;).  Delicious!</p>

				<p>Rachel- I have made them with half white whole wheat and half white, 2 % milk but still used real butter and they came out tasty but not as good as the original. They also didn&#8217;t rise nearly as much&#8211;even with the baking powder. When you use milk, they come out lighter like a biscuit instead of heavier like a scone.</p>

				<p>My first attempt ever at making scones and did it by hand.  They turned out sweeter and fluffier&#8211; not as dense as I expected, but that certainly didn&#8217;t make them any less delicious.  They were a hit with the family.  I&#8217;d make them again!</p>

				<p>I made these on the morning of Thanksgiving at my in-laws and they were fantastic!  I don&#8217;t think of myself as much of a scone person, since my previous experience has been with dry lumps of starch&#8230; but these were moist, flavorful, sweet, and buttery.  I&#8217;m already planning to make them again for Christmas at my family&#8217;s house.</p>

				<p>I have made these four times alreday &#8211; addictive for sure!  I second the suggestion to use turbinado sugar on top, the crunch is  a nice contrast. Also, my last batch with Fuji apples was the best by far.</p>

				<p>Just made these and took the first bite not a minute ago.  They are amazing!  I upped the cheddar a little (I&#8217;m an addict&#8230;) and did a 1:1 swap for 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flour instead of 1 cup of all-purpose.  I was too afraid to swap all the flour, but now I think it would have been awesome.  Thanks, as always!</p>

				<p>So I made these according to recipe not long ago&#8230; and they were great! For my second attempt, I replaced the cheddar with chopped cranberries instead, my market recently having had a sale and me being unable to resist. I happily anticipated this delicious, delicious flavor contrast.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while putting the dough together, I realized that I&#8217;d misread the recipe and put BOTH EGGS into the batter. I panicked, but just added enough flour to make it its normal consistency and skipped the egg wash, proceeding as normal in hopes that everything would turn out okay.</p>
<p>And&#8230; I gotta say&#8230; best culinary mistake I&#8217;ve ever made. The scones are much more rich and moist, and they keep for nearly five days. Not to mention the taste combination is just phenomenal. I think I may make my mistake variation more often!</p>

				<p>These were so, so delicious!  I made these with 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose; I might go to 3/4 cup of each next time to fool myself into thinking they&#8217;re healthy.  I also added about 1/3 cup of chopped pecans due to a ridiculous pecan surplus at our house.  Due to an equally ridiculous excess of apples that are slightly past their prime, languishing in a crisper drawer, I see several batches of these wonderful scones in my near future.  (I love so many Smitten Kitchen recipes: clementine cake, meatball sub, carrot-harissa salad, anything with asparagus&#8230;can&#8217;t wait for the cookbook!)</p>

				<p>Gorgeous stuff! I made them with 2/3 wholewheat &#8211; or is it wholemeal, I cannot get the hang of it &#8211; still they had enough rise and came out a wonderfull golden brown. The dough was ridiculously sticky, it was nigh impossible to cut the wedges. But I just scraped every bit that stuck where it didn&#8217;t belong together and slapped it onto a wedge &#8211; makes for a wonderfully imperfect rustic look.</p>
<p>Made a note to increase the cheddar a bit. I do like the gorgonzola/ pear combo suggested in the comments, but would def forgo sugar with that. On this more savoury note I plan to do a cherry tomato/ goat cheese version with rosemary.</p>

				<p>I just made these this evening to serve to a friend who was stopping by for tea. These scones were incredibly addictive! I did have to substitute light cream for heavy cream since that was all I had in my refrigerator. Despite the substitution, they were still nice and moist. A great way to use up the many apples from my apple tree. I can&#8217;t imagine these will last more than 2 days. Thank you for another wonderful recipe!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve never posted on a blog before but I just made these and I love them so much I cant help myself.  I used 3 very tiny granny smith apples and for some reason, an additional egg (reflex second egg adding from making a few too many batches of chocolate chip cookies maybe?).  Also just used my fingers and a big wooden spoon &#8211; thanks for the no mixer tips!</p>
<p>anyway &#8211; they were wonderfully awesome.  cant wait to make them again.  maybe right now.. maybe more cheese.. the world is my scone</p>

				<p>I just thought I&#8217;d finally update on my question (comment 264).  I ended up chopping them really small before roasting.  They turned out great, though I didn&#8217;t get a strong cheese flavor.  It was more of a pleasant back note, like, &#8220;Hmm, what is that??&#8221;</p>

				<p>Made these last weekend in an effort to try every apple or pumpkin breakfast-type recipe on the face of the Earth before the season&#8217;s over. Loved them! So yummy! Forgot the egg-wash but to no ill-effect (except maybe less sugar stuck to the top) but gorgeous and delicious anyways. Thanks again, Deb!</p>

				<p>I never commented on a blog before, and I know that this post is a while back. But after making this recipe tonight ( this is the tenth recipe I try from this website) I had to comment on how incredible each and every recipe is. My husband ( who hates apples by the way) was already stuffed when he decided to taste only a bite, and he ate three. Thank you deb for the recipes you share, when I try one I am always sure that the result will blow me away.</p>

				<p>These were a huge hit!  I was so proud because I&#8217;m not known for my baking skills but these were extremely tasty and the consistency was perfection. I&#8217;m glad I took the step of freezing a batch for the soon-to-be-arriving holiday house guests.</p>

				<p>I made these back in October when I finally got a KitchenAid stand mixer.  Since I had been whipping up many biscuits, scones, etc. that week, I froze these scones.  I baked them today, and they are delicious!  They have imparted a wonderful smell in my kitchen  The apple/cheddar combination works very well and is very balanced in this recipe.  I am now interested in making your other scone recipes as well!</p>

				<p>These were fabulous! I made them with 1/2 whole wheat flour, sifted several times to add air and added a tablespoon of applesauce just incase the wheat flour made the batch too dry. I only needed to cook them 23 minutes but they turned out perfect. Will for sure bake these again. Thanks!</p>

				<p>Dear Deb,<br />
Just three thoughts I would like to share.</p>
<p>I love your spirit of exploration in your work, right down to the how to on food photo taking!<br />
How amazingly thoughtful and considerate of you to reply to a random strangers question about light or heavy cream!  I wonderful hint at more of your character.<br />
And finally that this was my first recipe of yours that i made (year ago now) and my wife loves it.. honestly what more could i ask for!  </p>
<p>Good luck to you,  your family and to the success of your book  We love your work.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
W &amp; N and two little munchers</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m making these right now and am a bit confused&#8230;<br />
the directions call for salt, but the recipe doesn&#8217;t. I skimmed the comments and it seems no one else has noticed this? Am I just going crazy? I&#8217;m going to assume it should be 1/4-1/2 teaspoon salt?<br />
help!</p>

				<p>alexis &#8212; You are totally correct &#8212; it is missing! I&#8217;m always amused that a comment section can get as long as this one without me hearing about it. Here&#8217;s the clincher: I don&#8217;t have this cookbook anymore. But, your estimate sounds like the right addition. Good luck!</p>

				<p>These were amazingly good!!!! A couple of weeks ago I had friends visiting and staying over. When we woke up the morning after the Radiohead concert, I opened my tiny freezer, popped half of these in my tiny oven, and oh my, huge deliciousness emerged from my tiny kitchen, ideal for a post-concert not-tiny-at-all breakfast :p!!! They smelled heavenly as they were baking, I loved the apple and cheddar combination, but that was no surprise. The biggest surprise came the next day, when the boy and I shared the other half for breakfast. The boy isn&#8217;t such a lover of cheese in baked goods, but he found these surprisingly good!!!</p>
<p>So, thanks again for spying and trying and making up and sharing deliciousness!!</p>

				<p>Deb, </p>
<p>I am a long time fan!  I go here whenever I have to impress &#8211; boys, family, co-workers, classmates, etc.  And I impressed I have with your chicken and dumplings, all variations of empanadas, and so many more.</p>
<p>I just made these and LOVE them.  I added brown sugar and cinnamon to the scone lid = heaven (but what with butter is not?!)</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for your cookbook to have its rightful place on my (very, very) small kitchen counter!</p>
<p>You inspire!</p>
<p>Yours,<br />

				<p>Deb- Thanks for the input; I appreciate your time. I went the safe route and tried it with 8 to start, and it worked well. (I also put some bacon drippings in for a TBS of butter&#8230; definitely made it healthier.) Best of luck on your book tour. :)</p>

				<p>Hi Chen &#8212; Have you had cheddar cheese? See if you can find something else with the same flavor profile. If not, you&#8217;re looking for a semi-firm cheese that will melt evenly in the heat.</p>

				<p>These scones turned out great! I made them and froze to bake a couple days later, which worked beautifully. Next time I&#8217;ll take them full savory, with green onions and crumbled bacon and more cheese instead of sugar on top. This recipe is a keeper, thank you!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve wanted to make these for ages and had a go at them tonight, to have with roasted pumpkin soup for dinner. I used one Granny Smith and one Jonagold; a mixture of creme fraiche and natural yoghurt instead of heavy cream; and a Lancashire cheese instead of cheddar. The dough was extremely wet so I added a bit more flour, but still struggled to cut it and transfer it to the baking sheet without it flopping apart. Nevertheless, the resulting scones were delicious, although I don&#8217;t think the sugar is needed (certainly not on the top, at least). Maybe I was just expecting a more savoury scone &#8211; either way, I&#8217;ll probably make them again. They were definitely autumnal :)</p>
